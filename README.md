I'm a Automation/Mechanical Engineer at [Aprecia](https://www.aprecia.com/) working on 3DP Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Equipment. On my free time, I also work full stack applications which include CloudSenseIO, mechanical design projects on my 3D printers, or technical writing related to mechanical design and rapid prototyping.
